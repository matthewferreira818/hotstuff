# Game Companion: upgraded source

Matthew's local gaming companion is a Mac app that Codex built on his Mac. The
working copy lives in `~/Documents/Codex/2026-10-04/create-a-separate-free-local-ai/`.
This folder holds the upgraded `Companion.swift` so it can travel through git.

## What changed (2026-10-05)

1. **Bigger screenshots:** 1024 × 576 instead of 512 × 288, so menu and stat text can
   be read. Gemma 3 resizes every image to the same internal size, so this costs almost
   no extra model memory. JPEG quality went from 0.6 to 0.7.
2. **Game notes box:** a new field under "Local vision model". Whatever you type there
   goes in front of each question, capped at 400 characters, and is saved like the
   voice setting. It starts filled with the MCD2 soul build, so edit it any time.
   Notes are placed next to the question rather than in the system prompt. In the first
   test, the 4B model ignored notes in the system prompt and answered "Let me pull up
   your character sheet". The instructions now also tell it that it can't take actions,
   so it answers from the notes or says it can't tell.

3. **Fast mode** (2026-10-05, after the first live test): the old "Quicker follow-ups"
   button is now "Fast (AI stays loaded)". Picking it loads the AI right away and keeps
   it loaded for 10 minutes after each reply, with no 2-thread cap. Save memory still
   unloads after every reply, which is why every reply started slow. Matthew plays on a
   console and watches his Twitch on the Mac, so the Mac has room for it.
4. **Short / Detailed replies:** Detailed (the default) allows 2–4 sentences with
   specifics, up to 160 tokens. Short is the old one-liner. The context window is 2048
   for both, so switching never forces an AI reload.
5. **Voice list shows quality** (Premium / Enhanced / Basic). Download Premium voices in
   System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content → Manage Voices, then restart the app.
6. **Status shows "Taking a picture…" then "Thinking locally…"**, so it's clear which
   part is slow. The capture itself is fast; the AI is the slow part.

Same AI and same privacy as before.
This copy was not compiled before it was pushed, because the cloud machine has no Mac
SDK. The first rebuild on the Mac is the compile check.

## Install the upgrade

1. `cd ~/hotstuff && git pull`
2. Easiest: run `zsh ~/hotstuff/tools/game_companion/rebuild.sh`. It compiles first, keeps
   the old app as `outputs/GameCompanion-backup.app`, swaps in the new program, and re-signs
   it with the app's existing identity.
   Or paste this into Codex, in the Game Companion chat:

   > Copy ~/hotstuff/tools/game_companion/Companion.swift over outputs/Companion.swift
   > in this project. Rebuild and re-sign GameCompanion.app exactly the way you built
   > it before, with the same app name, bundle ID, icon and signing, so macOS keeps its
   > permissions. Only build it: don't run the AI, capture the screen, or download anything.
   > If it fails to compile, show me the error.

3. If macOS asks for Screen Recording or Microphone permission again, allow it. A
   rebuilt app can look "new" to macOS.
