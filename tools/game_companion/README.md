# Game Companion: upgraded source

Matthew's local gaming companion is a Mac app that Codex built on his Mac. The
working copy lives in `~/Documents/Codex/2026-10-04/create-a-separate-free-local-ai/`.
This folder holds the upgraded `Companion.swift` so it can travel through git.

## What changed (2026-10-05)

1. **Bigger screenshots:** 1024 × 576 instead of 512 × 288, so menu and stat text can
   be read. Gemma 3 resizes every image to the same internal size, so this costs almost
   no extra model memory. JPEG quality went from 0.6 to 0.7.
2. **Game notes box:** a new field under "Local vision model". Whatever you type there
   goes in front of each question, capped at 400 characters, and is saved like the
   voice setting. It starts filled with the MCD2 soul build, so edit it any time.
   Notes are placed next to the question rather than in the system prompt. In the first
   test, the 4B model ignored notes in the system prompt and answered "Let me pull up
   your character sheet". The instructions now also tell it that it can't take actions,
   so it answers from the notes or says it can't tell.

3. **Fast mode** (2026-10-05, after the first live test): the old "Quicker follow-ups"
   button is now "Fast (AI stays loaded)". Picking it loads the AI right away and keeps
   it loaded for 10 minutes after each reply, with no 2-thread cap. Save memory still
   unloads after every reply, which is why every reply started slow. Matthew plays on a
   console and watches his Twitch on the Mac, so the Mac has room for it.
4. **Short / Detailed replies:** Detailed (the default) allows 2–4 sentences with
   specifics, up to 160 tokens. Short is the old one-liner. The context window is 2048
   for both, so switching never forces an AI reload.
5. **Voice list shows quality** (Premium / Enhanced / Basic). Download Premium voices in
   System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content → Manage Voices, then restart the app.
6. **Status shows "Taking a picture…" then "Thinking locally…"**, so it's clear which
   part is slow. The capture itself is fast; the AI is the slow part.

7. **Live buddy (2026-10-05):** a new first tab, in `Live.swift`. It streams the chosen window
   (one JPEG a second, 1024 × 576) and the mic (16 kHz PCM) to Google's Gemini Live API
   (`gemini-3.8-live`, free tier) over a WebSocket. It plays the spoken replies (24 kHz PCM)
   and shows both transcripts. Built from ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/get-started-websocket.
   - The key is pasted by Matthew into the app and stored in the macOS Keychain, never in files.
   - Context-window compression is on, because without it Google caps audio+video at 2 minutes.
   - Session resumption reconnects when Google ends the connection, about every 10 minutes.
   - The "I'm wearing headphones" box: when it's unticked, the mic pauses while the buddy talks
     so it can't hear itself.
   - Google Search grounding: a toggle, on by default, adds `tools: [{googleSearch: {}}]` so it
     looks up facts about new games instead of guessing. It runs on Google's side. Google's pricing
     page (2026-10-05) lists it as supported on the free tier for the 3.8 Live models.
   - Privacy differs from the Local tab: frames and mic audio go to Google while it's on, and
     Google's free tier may use them to improve its products.

The Local tab keeps the same AI and the same privacy as before.
This copy was syntax-checked with `swiftc -parse` on Linux but not compiled, because the
cloud machine has no Mac SDK. The first rebuild on the Mac is the full compile check.

## Install the upgrade

1. `cd ~/hotstuff && git pull`
2. Easiest: run `zsh ~/hotstuff/tools/game_companion/rebuild.sh`. It compiles first, keeps
   the old app as `outputs/GameCompanion-backup.app`, swaps in the new program, and re-signs
   it with the app's existing identity.
   Or paste this into Codex, in the Game Companion chat:

   > Copy ~/hotstuff/tools/game_companion/Companion.swift over outputs/Companion.swift
   > in this project. Rebuild and re-sign GameCompanion.app exactly the way you built
   > it before, with the same app name, bundle ID, icon and signing, so macOS keeps its
   > permissions. Only build it: don't run the AI, capture the screen, or download anything.
   > If it fails to compile, show me the error.

3. If macOS asks for Screen Recording or Microphone permission again, allow it. A
   rebuilt app can look "new" to macOS.

## Make permissions survive rebuilds (one time)

Each ad hoc signature is different, so after every rebuild macOS forgets the Screen Recording
permission and asks for the Keychain password again. The fix is a self-signed code-signing
certificate, which `rebuild.sh` uses automatically when it exists:

1. Run `zsh ~/hotstuff/tools/game_companion/make_cert.sh`. Newer macOS replaced Keychain Access
   with the Passwords app, which can't make certificates, so the script does it with Apple's openssl
   and `security import`.
2. If the certificate exists but codesign won't use it, rebuild.sh falls back to ad hoc signing
   instead of leaving a broken app.
3. Rebuild. If macOS asks to let codesign use the key, enter the Mac password and choose Always Allow.
4. Redo the screen permission and the Keychain "Always Allow" one last time.
