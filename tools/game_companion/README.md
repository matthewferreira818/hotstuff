# Game Companion: upgraded source

Matthew's local gaming companion is a Mac app that Codex built on his Mac. The
working copy lives in `~/Documents/Codex/2026-10-04/create-a-separate-free-local-ai/`.
This folder holds the upgraded `Companion.swift` so it can travel through git.

## What changed (2026-10-05)

1. **Bigger screenshots:** 1024 × 576 instead of 512 × 288, so menu and stat text can
   be read. Gemma 3 resizes every image to the same internal size, so this costs almost
   no extra model memory. JPEG quality went from 0.6 to 0.7.
2. **Game notes box:** a new field under "Local vision model". Whatever you type there
   is added to the AI's instructions, capped at 400 characters, and saved like the
   voice setting. It starts filled with the MCD2 soul build, so edit it any time.

Nothing else changed: same AI, same memory settings, same voice, same privacy.
This copy was not compiled before it was pushed, because the cloud machine has no Mac
SDK. The first rebuild on the Mac is the compile check.

## Install the upgrade

1. `cd ~/hotstuff && git pull`
2. Paste this into Codex, in the Game Companion chat:

   > Copy ~/hotstuff/tools/game_companion/Companion.swift over outputs/Companion.swift
   > in this project. Rebuild and re-sign GameCompanion.app exactly the way you built
   > it before, with the same app name, bundle ID, icon and signing, so macOS keeps its
   > permissions. Only build it: don't run the AI, capture the screen, or download anything.
   > If it fails to compile, show me the error.

3. If macOS asks for Screen Recording or Microphone permission again, allow it. A
   rebuilt app can look "new" to macOS.
